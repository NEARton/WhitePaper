# The $NEXP token
$NEXP ( **N**EAR e**X**perience **P**oints) is the utility and loyalty token dedicated to NFT enthusiasts on [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/).

The main purpose of the __$NEXP__ token is to reward early NFT adopters on [NEAR](https://near.org/) and add additional utility for our NFTs & others collections.

__But what about utility?__

* Ability to buy NEARton NFTs via __$NEXP__
* NEARton will create the ecosystem around it so both residents and guests will be
able to spend __$NEXP__ inside the town.
* Partnerships with NFT collections will let people buy some part of supply via __$NEXP__

__Loyalty aspect:__

Think about __$NEXP__ not only as "money", it's like __XP__ in RPG. The more good NFTs you collect, the more __$NEXP__ you get.

__$NEXP__  is the opportunity for the devs to engage their holders in the long term and give another reason to HODL their NFTs.
